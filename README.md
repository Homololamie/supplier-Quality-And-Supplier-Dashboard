# Supplier-Quality-And-Performance-Dashboard
This Repository Contains Supplier Quality And Performance Analysis Across Multiple Dimensions Such As Vendors, Plants, Materials, And Defect Types. 

## Project Overview
The case study presented focuses on a manufacturing company struggling to monitor and improve supplier performance effectively. By leveraging business intelligence tools, the company centralized procurement data and generated actionable insights to address critical challenges such as material defects, vendor reliability, and production downtime.
Power BI is used to analyze supplier quality and performance across key dimensions, including vendors, plants, materials, and defect types. The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of defects, downtime, and their financial impact, enabling manufacturers to pinpoint problem areas and implement strategies to enhance supplier quality and reduce operational inefficiencies.

## Data Model

The Dashboard Was Built Using A Star Schema Data Model For Optimal Performance And Ease Of Analysis. Key Dimensions Such As Vendor, Plant, Material Type, And Defect Type Were 
Separated Into Individual Tables, While A Fact Table Was Created For Metrics Like Defect Quantity And Downtime.

- Fact Table: Contains Core Metrics Such As Total Defect Qty And Downtime Hours.
- Dimension Tables: Includes Vendor, Plant Location, Material Type, Defect Type, And Other Related Attributes.
- Date Table: Supports Time-Based Analysis, Making It Possible To Track Trends And Filter Reports By Time Periods.
